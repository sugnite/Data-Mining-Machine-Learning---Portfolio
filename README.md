# Data-Mining-Machine-Learning---Portfolio
This project was carried out as part of my 'Data Mining and Machine Learning' course at Heriot-Watt University.

I did suceed all the part of the CW. I was well helped by my labl tutor Marco, again many thanks for his support !

Even if my dataset was challenging because of its variety, and gave hard time, I really enjoyed working on this portfolio. I did my best until the last line and hope this was transcribed into my work.

As my tutor has found my work to be very good and complete, I hope other people will have fun browsing it.

I remain available to discuss my work if some people want to contact me.

PS: Several functions of this portfolio were extracted from Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems Book by Aurelien Geron. This book was the reference suppoort in our coursework. Other function can from all around internet. Of course main functions and improvement of other functions was designed by myself.
